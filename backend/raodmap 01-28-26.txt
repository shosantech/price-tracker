Step 0: Price & News Collection
--------------------------------
Daily fetch:
  - Gold prices (daily candles: open, high, low, close, volume)
  - News articles (gold-related)
Stored in DB:
  - gold_prices table
  - news table
  - weekly news summary table

Step 1: Technical & Sentiment Analysis
--------------------------------------
Technical indicators:
  - Moving Averages (MA10, MA20, MA50, MA200)
  - RSI
  - ATR / volatility
  - Price structure flags (support/resistance)

Sentiment analysis:
  - Score news articles (VADER + relevance + source credibility)
  - Compute avg weekly sentiment
  - Deduplicate & weight top articles

Step 2: Generate Level 1 + Level 2 Signals
------------------------------------------
Level 1: basic signal fusion
  - Combine technical + sentiment
  - Apply confidence logic (alignment, HOLD reduces confidence)
  - Determine regime (TRENDING vs RANGING)

Level 2: enhanced
  - Weighted signals based on past history
  - Adjust thresholds based on volatility, dispersion, trends
  - Gold asymmetry: fear > optimism

Step 3: Signal Logging & History
--------------------------------
Log each signal to DB:
  - Date, Price, Technical signal, Sentiment signal
  - Combined signal, Confidence, Regime
  - Future outcome (profit/loss after X days/weeks)
Purpose:
  - Track accuracy
  - Generate performance metrics
  - Basis for feedback loop

v

Step 4: Alerts & Notifications
-------------------------------
Trigger alerts when:
  - Price approaches critical levels (support/resistance)
  - Strong signal confidence (BUY/SELL)

Step 6: Feedback Loop & Adaptive Improvement
---------------------------------------------
Use logged signals & outcomes to:
  - Assess which indicators / weights are most predictive
  - Adjust thresholds for confidence, signal fusion
  - Identify systematic errors (false BUY/SELL)
  - Suggest parameter improvements automatically (or semi-automated)

Step 7: Profit Compounding Strategy
-----------------------------------
Once reliable:
  - Track each trade (BUY → SELL → rebuy)
  - Calculate realized profit in USD and gold ounces
  - Adjust trade size for compounding
  - Optimize over months/years for asset growth
